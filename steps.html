    <!-- <div id="codeinput"> -->
    <p class="steps">
        If you are using google chrome, firefox, opera gx, on a mobile device, they won't be able to download your response sheet as an html file. The download option in their menus downloads it in another format. <br>
        A fast option is to download a different browser or app.<br>
        An app which allows you to do this is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.html.htmlviewer">HTML Viewer</a>. <br>
        Steps for downloading response sheet as an html file on Android/Mobile using HTML Viewer application: <br>
        1. Open your Jee mains response sheet on NTA's website. <br>
        2. Click on the url bar and copy the url. <br>
        3. Paste the url in the HTML Viewer app. <br>
        4. Click on the View Source button. This will show you the source of the website<br>
        5. Click on the download button in the top right and save the file with a file name like "Jee Mains Response Sheet.html" <br>
        Notes: You can also get your response sheet url if you have previously accessed it by searching for cdn3 in your browser history
